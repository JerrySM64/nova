# This is needed because SDDM themes are only loaded from /usr/share/sddm/themes. Due to the nature of Fedora Atomic
# (and therefore Nova), a mount from a writable path is required as a workaround. This will be removed when SDDM
# gets an option implemented to load themes from Atomic-friendly locations (e.g. /usr/local/share/sddm/themes)
# Special thanks to the Universal Blue project for figuring it out!
